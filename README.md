# Refrain ðŸŽ¶ðŸ™‰

*Collaborative playlists in Slack*

Refrain is an open source, host-it-yourself clone of
[Jukebot](https://getjukebot.com). It allows you to share your Spotify account
with your office and your taste in music with one another, for better or for
worse.

The command names have been chosen to avoid conflicts with the Jukebot slash
commands so that you can trial them side-by-side.


## Prerequisites

You will need:
- a server to host Refrain on
- a MongoDB cluster
- a [Spotify developer account](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)


## Setup

1. Clone this repository on your server and create a `.env` file in its
   directory. Add your server's address and your database address like so:
   ```bash
   HOST=http://your.server.domain
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your.db.domain
   ```
2. Head over to [your Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click *Create
   New App*. Give it a name and attach it to your workspace.
3. In *OAuth & Permissions*, select the scopes *Add commands to my workspace*
   and *Send messages as Refrain*. Hit the big green install button at the top
   of the page, then copy your OAuth access token and add it to your `.env`
   like so: `SLACK_API_TOKEN=xoxp-...`.
4. In *Slash Commands*, add each of the commands in the table above. The
   request URL is `http://your.server.domain/command` for all of them.
5. In *Interactive Components*, click *Enable Interactive Components* and put
   `http://your.server.domain/interactive` in the *Request URL* field, then
   click the big green button.
6. On the Spotify developer site, click *Create an app* and go through the
   setup. Copy your client ID and client secret into your `.env` with the
   `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` keys, respectively.
7. On the Spotify developer site, click *Edit settings* and add
   `http://your.server.domain/callback`. Hit *Save* at the bottom.
8. Fire up Refrain on your server. You can use [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io)
   (recommended) or just `node src/app.js`.

- Improved playlist handling: let users know when Spotify has veered off
  into another playlist, as this causes the most API errors
- Alias all slash commands to /refrain to reduce the tedium of setup
- Volume control
- Handle Spotify API timeouts
